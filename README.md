# BadUSB-Roulette for the DigiSpark ATTiny85. 

  The BadUSB is a revolver. 
    The barrel holds three bullets.
      Plug the BadUSB in to see which bullet is in the chamber.
        Unplug it to select the next bullet.
          Or leave it in to fire that bullet.
      Just like Russian Roulette, except you control the bullet. 
  
  Which, I guess, makes it normal Roulette... the kind everyone necessarily plays when a revolver is involved.
