# BadUSB-Roulette for the DigiSpark ATTiny85. 

  The BadUSB is a revolver. /n
    The barrel holds three bullets. /n
      Plug the BadUSB in to see which bullet is in the chamber. /n
        Unplug it to select the next bullet. /n
          Or leave it in to fire that bullet. /n
      Just like Russian Roulette, except you control the bullet. /n
  /n
  Which, I guess, makes it normal Roulette... the kind everyone necessarily plays when a revolver is involved. /n
