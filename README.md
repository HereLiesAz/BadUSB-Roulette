# BadUSB-Roulette for the DigiSpark ATTiny85. 

  The BadUSB is a revolver. <br>
    The barrel holds three bullets. <br>
      Plug the BadUSB in to see which bullet is in the chamber. <br>
        Unplug it to select the next bullet. <br>
          Or leave it in to fire that bullet. <br>
      Just like Russian Roulette, except you control the bullet. <br>
<br>
    Which, I guess, makes it normal Roulette... the kind everyone necessarily plays when a revolver is involved. <br>
